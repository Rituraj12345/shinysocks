# ShinySOCKS

## Mission Statement

*To create a small, ultrafast SOCKS proxy server.

## Background

I sometimes use VPN. In one case, I have a VPN access only
from a Windows 7 virtual machine trough some proprietary 
"security by obscurity" VPN software. In order to work 
efficiently, I need to connect my Linux workstation to that 
VPN. Network routing and IP forwarding seems not to work, 
so the second best option in my case is SOCKS. Socks 
trough Putty works, kind of. It's slow and unreliable. 

I tried a few free SOCKS servers. Neither of them worked, so 
therefore I'm spending a few hours writing my own.

## Current State
The project is currently under initial development.

## License
ShinySOCKS is released under GPLv3. 
It is Free. 
Free as in Free Beer. 
Free as in Free Air.
